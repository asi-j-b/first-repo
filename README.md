# Authorship Info
Asi John Bolina

I took a subject, Software Construction, at WSU this year. This is where I learned the concept of version control, and developing a codebase using optimal practises of software engineering.

# App Objective
This app is a habit tracker with a gamification feature inspired by Duolingo lesson streaks. The more consistently the user uses the app (every day) the more they learn and build good habits.

# Current Progress
I want to make the navigation clear. 
Authentication and authorisation is important to ensure there aren't any security breaches when this website goes public. I want to implement what I learned from Software Engineering Fundamentals, Technologies for Web Applications, and Software Construction into my app so it shows I do personal projects on the side as well.
